Retail Orders Data Analysis
Project Overview
This project focuses on advanced SQL analysis and Python data processing to extract actionable business insights from retail order data. While Python (Pandas) is used for data cleaning, the core of the analysis is driven by SQL queries to solve complex business problems.

Tools Used
SQL: For data aggregation, ranking, and complex business logic.

Python (Pandas): For initial data cleaning and preprocessing.

Jupyter Notebook: To document the step-by-step analytical process.

Kaggle Dataset: Source of the retail sales data.

Core SQL Tasks
Ranking: Identifying top-performing products using DENSE_RANK().

Time-Series Analysis: Comparing sales growth across different months.

Aggregation: Calculating total revenue and profit margins by category.

Subqueries & CTEs: Breaking down complex business questions into manageable steps
