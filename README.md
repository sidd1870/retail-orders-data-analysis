## Project Overview

This project focuses on SQL analysis supported by Python for data cleaning and preprocessing. The objective is to extract actionable business insights from retail order data by solving real-world analytical problems using SQL.

Python with Pandas is used for initial data preparation, while the core analytical work is performed using SQL queries, including aggregations, rankings, and time-series analysis.

## Tools and Technologies Used

SQL for data aggregation, window functions, ranking
Python (Pandas) for data cleaning and preprocessing
Jupyter Notebook for documenting the analytical workflow
Kaggle dataset as the source of retail sales data

## Core SQL Analysis Tasks

### Ranking Analysis

Identified top-performing products using the DENSE_RANK function.

### Time-Series Analysis

Compared sales performance and growth across different months.

### Aggregation and Metrics

Calculated total revenue and profit margins by product category.

### Subqueries and CTEs

Used subqueries and Common Table Expressions to break down complex business questions into manageable steps.

## Project Objective

To demonstrate strong SQL analytical skills and the ability to transform raw retail data into meaningful business insights.
